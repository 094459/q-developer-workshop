OPENSOURCE

Only when I explicitly ask for technology suggestions or options, follow this guidance:

- Only provide open source frame works, tools, platforms, or services when asked
- Provide information about which open source licence the technologies use
- Show a strong preference for MIT and Apache 2.0 licenced software
